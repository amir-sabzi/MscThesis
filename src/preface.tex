In greater detail, the subsequent paragraphs elaborate on the origins of the text and material presented in this thesis.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\Cref{ch:introduction}}: The introduction is written by me. 
  \item \textbf{\Cref{ch:background}}: Background and Prior is largely written by me. However, {\sys}'s threat model (\ref{subsec:threat-model}) shares content with the NetShaper paper.
  \item \textbf{\Cref{ch:dp-shaping}}: The content of \Cref{ch:dp-shaping} is derived from Section 3 of the NetShaper paper {\addref}, which is written by me in collaboration with my advisors, Aastha Mehta and Mathias L\'{e}cuyer. 
  \item \textbf{\Cref{ch:design-implementation}}: The content of this chapter partially derived from Section 4 of the NetShaper paper {\addref}, which is written by me in collaboration with my advisor, Aastha Mehta. \Cref{sec:tunnel-overview} and \Cref{sec:tunnel-design} are mostly taken from the paper while the rest of this chapter is written independently.
