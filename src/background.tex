We begin this chapter by discussing the problem of network side-channel attacks in \Cref{sec:ns-attacks} and exploring various proposed mitigations for such attacks in \Cref{sec:ns-defenses}.
We, then, present a comprehensive definition of differential privacy (DP), outline its key properties, and highlight its primary applications, thereby setting the foundation for proposing our differentially private traffic shaping mechanism in \Cref{sec:dp-background}.
Finally, in \Cref{sec:background-quic} we conclude this chapter by providing a brief overview of QUIC protocol, which plays a pivotal role in the design of {\sys}.
