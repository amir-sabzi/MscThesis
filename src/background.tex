In this chapter, we begin by discussing the problem of network side-channel attacks and exploring various proposed mitigations for such attacks. 
Following that, we present a comprehensive definition of differential privacy (DP), outline its key properties, and highlight its primary applications, thereby setting the foundation for elucidating our differentially private traffic shaping mechanism.
