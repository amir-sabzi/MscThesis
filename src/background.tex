\chapter{Background and Prior Work}\label{ch:background}
% Background intro. Explaining what you've included in this section. 
% TODO: update if you add more to background
In this chapter, we overview the required background for the thesis and summarize the related work. 
We begin chapter by providing a background on QUIC transport protocol, which plays a pivotal role in the design and implementation of {\sys}.
We, then, present a comprehensive definition of differential privacy (DP), outline its key properties, and highlight its primary applications, thereby setting the foundation for proposing our differentially private traffic shaping mechanism.
Finally, we conclude this chapter by discussing the problem of network side-channel attacks and exploring various proposed mitigations for such attacks.
