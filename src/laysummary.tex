\chapter{Lay Summary}
Internet applications have long relied on encryption to protect our online security and privacy. However, researchers have discovered a potential vulnerability called network side-channel attacks. These attacks use the pattern of encrypted network traffic to infer sensitive information about users.
One way to counter these attacks is through "traffic shaping," where the traffic pattern is modified to hide the content being transmitted. However, striking the right balance between privacy and overhead can be tricky. To address this, we introduce a novel network side-channel mitigation framework called {\sys}. It dynamically reshapes traffic at regular intervals, ensuring privacy remains intact even during long communication sessions.
Furthermore, {\sys} provide formal and quantifiable privacy guarantees. 
{\sys} offers extensive configurability, allowing users to manage privacy, overhead, and latency effectively. Moreover, it defeats state-of-the-art traffic analysis attacks and provides robust theoretical privacy guarantees, protecting users from future, more sophisticated attacks.
