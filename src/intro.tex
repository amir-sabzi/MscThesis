%% At a high level, what is the problem area you are working in and why is it important? 
%% It is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?
For years, Internet applications relied solely on end-to-end encryption of network traffic to ensure security and privacy.
Transport Layer security (TLS) protocol, for example, is widely used in different applications such as email, VoIP, and most notably HTTPS.{\addref}
TLS utilizes block cipher algorithms, such as AES, to ensure data confidentiality.
Block ciphers operate on input blocks of size $n$ using a fixed size key and produce output blocks of the same size $n$, revealing the size of the data before encryption. {\addref}
Employing adequate data encryption methods is effective in concealing the content of traffic.
However, by monitoring encrypted packet sizes and their timing in the network, observers can subsequently infer the size of users' data and the timing of its transmission, collectively referred to as the traffic pattern.
Traffic pattern is highly correlated with its content.
Hence, leveraging this correlation, an adversary in control of the underlying network links (e.g., Internet Service Providers) can monitor the traffic pattern and thereby expose the content of the communication.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the traffic pattern can inadvertently expose various sensitive information, including the video being watched~\cite{schuster2017beautyburst}, the websites visited by users~\cite{wang2014supersequence, bhat2019varcnn}, and even the content of VoIP calls~\cite{white2011phonotactic}.
This type of privacy leakage is commonly known as network side-channel attacks.



% Section 2: Elaboration
% What is the specific problem considered in this paper? 
% This section narrows down the topic area of the thesis. In the first section you have established general context and importance. Here you establish specific context and background.
The primary approach to mitigate network side-channel attacks is through traffic shaping. In this method, a defense mechanism actively modifies the traffic pattern to ensure that the pattern of data transmission is either independent of the content or that the correlation between content and pattern is bounded.  
One naive strategy for traffic shaping to mitigate network side-channel leaks is to add dummy traffic to the application data and adjust the pattern of traffic to maintain a constant-rate transmission.
While constant-rate traffic shaping provides utmost privacy, it unavoidably results in significant bandwidth overhead.
This is due to the transmission of large amounts of dummy traffic even when there is no actual data to be transmitted~\cite{saponas2007devices}.  
An alternative approach is to modify the pattern of traffic to a variable-rate pattern, thereby altering the trade-offs between privacy and overhead.
Variable-rate shaping strategies aim to decrease bandwidth overheads at the expense of potentially compromising privacy.
Balancing the trade-offs between privacy and overheads can be challenging without a proper method to quantitatively measure and evaluate privacy guarantees. 
Consequently, in the absence of a standardized notation for privacy, relying on ad-hoc heuristics for variable-rate traffic shaping may potentially result in uncontrolled privacy leaks~\cite{gong2020zero, cai2014csbuflo, lu2018dynaflow, juarez2016wtfpad, cai2014tamaraw}.
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly empowered network side-channel attacks, as they have enhanced attackers' ability to accurately map the noisy traffic pattern to its corresponding content~\cite{schuster2017beautyburst, bhat2019varcnn, hayes2016kfp, sirinam2018df}.
To particularly address ML-based attacks, one approach is to introduce ad-hoc~\cite{luo2011httpos} or adversarial noise~\cite{shan2021dolos, nasr2021blind, rahman2020mockingbird} into the traffic traces, aiming to obfuscate them and make it more challenging to infer the content of the traffic by observing its pattern. 
However, these methods also lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on the assessment of privacy through existing network side-channel attacks.
As attacks continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, certain older defense mechanisms fail to be effective against newer ML-based attacks~\cite{sirinam2018df}, leading to an ongoing arms race between attackers and defense mechanisms.

An efficient defense mechanism, designed based on a standardized notion of privacy, offers two significant advantages. Firstly, it brings an end to the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defense mechanisms. Secondly, it enables users to effectively balance the trade-offs between overheads and privacy according to their specific requirements.
