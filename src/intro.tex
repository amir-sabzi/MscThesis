% Section 1: Motivation
%% At a high level, what is the problem area you are working in and why is it important? 
%% It is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?
For years, Internet applications relied on end-to-end encryption of network traffic to ensure security and privacy.
Transport Layer security (TLS) protocol, for example, is widely used in different applications such as email, VoIP, and most notably HTTPS~\cite{rfc2818}.
TLS utilizes block cipher algorithms, such as AES, to ensure data confidentiality.
Block ciphers operate on fixed-sized data blocks of using a key and produce output blocks of the same size, revealing the size of the data before encryption. 
Employing provably secure data encryption methods is effective in concealing the content of traffic.
However, observers can infer the size of users' data and the timing of its transmission by monitoring encrypted packet sizes and their timing in the network.
We collectively refer to packet sizes and timing as traffic shape.
Traffic shape is highly correlated with its content.
Hence, leveraging this correlation, an adversary in control of the underlying network links (e.g., Internet Service Providers) can monitor the traffic shape and thereby potentially expose the content of the communication.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the traffic shape can inadvertently expose a variety of sensitive information, including the video being watched~\cite{schuster2017beautyburst}, the websites visited by users~\cite{wang2014supersequence, bhat2019varcnn}, and even the content of VoIP calls~\cite{white2011phonotactic}.
In literature, this type of privacy leakage is commonly known as network side-channel attacks.



% Section 2: Elaboration
% What is the specific problem considered in this paper? 
% This section narrows down the topic area of the thesis. In the first section you have established general context and importance. Here you establish specific context and background.
One approach to mitigate network side-channel attacks is through traffic shaping. 
In this method, the traffic shaper actively modifies the traffic shape to ensure that the pattern of data transmission is independent of the content.  
One naive strategy for traffic shaping to mitigate network side-channel leaks is to add dummy traffic to the application data and adjust the traffic shape to maintain a constant-rate transmission.
While constant-rate traffic shaping provides utmost privacy, it unavoidably results in either significant bandwidth overhead, substantial latency overhead, or both, depending on the configured traffic rate.
This is due to the transmission of large amounts of dummy traffic even when there is no actual data to be transmitted~\cite{saponas2007devices}.

An alternative approach is to modify the traffic shape to a variable-rate pattern, thereby altering the trade-offs between privacy and overheads.
Variable-rate shaping strategies aim to decrease bandwidth and latency overheads at the expense of potentially compromising privacy.
Balancing  this trade-off can be challenging without a proper method to quantitatively measure and evaluate privacy guarantees. 
Consequently, in the absence of a formal notation for quantifying privacy, relying on ad-hoc heuristics for variable-rate traffic shaping may potentially result in overestimating the privacy of a traffic shaping mechanism in the face of emerging attacks.~\cite{gong2020zero, cai2014csbuflo, lu2018dynaflow, juarez2016wtfpad, cai2014tamaraw}.
Specifically, recent advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly empowered network side-channel attacks, as they have enhanced attackers' ability to accurately map the noisy traffic shape to its corresponding content~\cite{schuster2017beautyburst, bhat2019varcnn, hayes2016kfp, sirinam2018df}.

To particularly address ML-based attacks, one approach is to introduce ad-hoc~\cite{luo2011httpos} or adversarial noise~\cite{shan2021dolos, nasr2021blind, rahman2020mockingbird} into the traffic traces, aiming to obfuscate them and make it more challenging for ML model to infer the content of the traffic by observing its pattern. 
However, these methods also lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on the assessment of privacy through existing network side-channel attacks.
As attacks continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, certain older defense mechanisms fail to be effective against newer ML-based attacks~\cite{sirinam2018df}, leading to an ongoing arms race between attackers and defense mechanisms. 
On the other hand, an efficient defense mechanism designed based on a formal notion of privacy, offers two significant advantages: First, it brings an end to the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defense mechanisms by ensuring future attacks can not breach the privacy of users.
Secondly, it enables users to effectively balance the trade-offs between overheads and privacy according to their specific requirements.  


% Section 3: Contribution
% what are the main contributions of your paper given the context you have established in paragraphs 1 and 2.
% What is the general approach taken?
% Why are the specific results significant?
%% Thinks I want to highlight in this paragraph:
%%% - our framework uses DP for: 1- quantitative privacy guarantee, 2- future-proof guarantees
%%% - it is dynamic, and therefore, it does not need traffic monitoring 
%%% - we design it to be an independent (module?) that can be deployed anywhere along the path of traffic, we decided to implement in a middebox 
In this work, we introduce a novel framework called {\sys} for network side-channel mitigation.
Our framework leverages the concept of differential privacy (DP) to provide formal privacy guarantees.
{\sys} partitions traffic traces into windows of transmission and reshapes each window dynamically to achieve per-window DP guarantees.
{\sys} applies traffic shaping in periodic intervals, achieving DP guarantees at granularity of these intervals. 
These per-interval DP guarantees can be composed together to quantify the overall privacy of a traffic trace, based on its length.
{\sys} offers extensive configurability, enabling applications to effectively manage the trade-offs between privacy, bandwidth overhead, and latency of communication.
Furthermore, in a bidirectional communication, applications can configure privacy/overhead parameters of each direction independently.
{\sys} defeats the state-of-the-art traffic analysis attacks.
Additionally, it provides robust theoretical privacy guarantees for traffic shaping, ensuring that the privacy of users remains intact even in the face of future attacks.
We design {\sys} as a modular traffic shaping tunnel endpoint that can be seamlessly integrated with any network stack along the path of traffic, providing flexibility and adaptability.
To enhance the scalability of {\sys}, we position it within a middlebox, enabling it to deliver privacy guarantees for multiple applications with low overheads. 
This design further enhances the application-agnostic nature of {\sys}, as it eliminates the need for modifications on the end-hosts.
